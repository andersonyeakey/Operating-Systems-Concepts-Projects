# Operating Systems Concepts Projects
A short collection of projects I worked on in CIS 452 at Grand Valley State University, in my junior year.
## Baking Project
This project involved creating a kind of "baking contest" in which any number of bakers could be created, they have a list of recipes to make, and they access the ingredients to make those recipes using shared memory and semaphores.
## One Bad Apple
This project involved creating a ring of processes that pass around an "apple" or a message. The processes use Linux signals to pass the "apple", and a selected process gets access to read the message in shared memory.
